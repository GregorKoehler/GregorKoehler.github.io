I am Gregor Koehler, a soon to be PhD student in Computer Science at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.
From October 10 2017 I will be traveling South/Southeast Asia, while sporadically blogging and working remotely for a german startup called Nextjournal.

I did my master's in physics and maintain a broad interest in machine learning so physics/ML will be recurrent themes for this blog, as well as occasional travel impressions and whatever else I think is worth sharing.
