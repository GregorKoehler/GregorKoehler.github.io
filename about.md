I am Gregor Koehler,  
a PhD student in Computer Science at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.
Before that I did my master's in physics at KIT in Karlsruhe. During that time I started to develop a broad interest 
for various topics within the field of machine learning. Consequently, ML and physics related topcis will be recurrent
themes for this blog. Apart from this I also like to play around with drones, both video drones and racing quads. Maybe
there will be some posts on these adventures in the future.  
For the second half of 2017 I have been writing ML articles (mostly intros on different topics) for a german startup 
called Nextjournal. This startup is currently still in "beta", but will soon provide a hosted environment for computer 
aided research with many nice  benefits for the researcher as well as users who want to reproduce other people's
research.
