I am Gregor Koehler, a PhD student in Computer Science at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg.
From June 2017 on I have been writing machine learning articles for a german startup called Nextjournal which aims to make computer aided science reproducible for everyone.

I did my master's in physics and maintain a broad interest in machine learning so physics/ML will be recurrent themes for this blog, as well as occasional travel impressions and whatever else I think is worth sharing (hint: Gadgets).
