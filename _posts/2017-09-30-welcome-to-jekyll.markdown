Welcome to my blog! This blog serves as a medium to share things that I find interesting and think others might be interested in as well. I plan to blog about many things ranging from topics in machine learning to my experiences while traveling (and working remotely) and maybe even some thoughts/ideas about fun gadgets and the possible symbiosis of real-world objects and machine learning! Because like my brother, I've always had a fondness for new gadgets.

As for this first 'hello world' type of blog post I thought it would be best to give a small and concise tutorial on how to set up this very thing you're looking at right now. A blog hosted on github - because chances are if you're reading this that you also got a github account.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
