Welcome to the paper corner!  

Here I plan to provide summaries and thoughts on papers I read, as well as links to implementations and additional resources.
This aims to help people navigate through the abundance of papers more efficiently without any claims about completeness.  
So if you think I'm not doing justice to some paper or you have additional resources/thoughts you think are worth sharing, please
contact me via email.
